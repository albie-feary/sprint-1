pwd     This tells you where you are. Stands for Print Working Directory and so tells you which folder you are in.
mkdir   This creates a new folder. Stands for Make Directory and so makes a folder in that folder your currently in. -p creates a path so you can create multiple directories in that path.
ls      This lists what is in that folder. If we want to see more than what is in that folder then we can add 'flags' -a= all, -l uses a long list and -t orders the files & directories by the time they were last modified.
cd      This changes the directory. Stands for... Change Directory! We can move up directories using .. and can move multiple directories using / to separate the paths.
rmdir   This removes a directory. Stands for Remove Directory and so deletes that folder so long as nothing is within it. rm -rf is the command to delete a directory if there is a folder within but be very careful in doing so!
atom .  This command opens atom. Atom is a text editor
pushd   This command takes your current directory and 'Pushes' it into another directory later. Its like saying "save where I am and then go here."
popd    This command takes the last directory you pushed and 'Pops' it off, taking you there.
cp      This command copies a file from one location to another. ie cp sun.txt wind.txt, Here we copied sun into wind.
mv      This command 'moves' a directory by renaming them. So by using the command mv sun wind, this renames sun as wind.
