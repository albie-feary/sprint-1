The Command Line is the computer's space where use of text creates commands and actions. We can create files known as directories and move them around. It is how programmers keep these files organised.
Just as we navigate through a computer using a mouse and selecting actions, we can use commands to create outputs and actions.
The use of the Command Line is helpful to programmers as we use it as a central point to work on projects from Github which is an online workspace forum used by millions of programmers.
By 'pulling' projects down from GitHub, making incrimental changes and 'commiting' them back up to Github by 'pushing' them there we can keep a keen eye on changes.
